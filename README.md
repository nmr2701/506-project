# 506-project


Project purpose: The purpose of the project is to create an application that would allow researchers in Biology at Boston University to share findings in Microbiomes from their research through a web application. The web application will allow users to search for data based on filters and display a series of informational, statistical inferences and plots which would deliver insights on the underlying data.

Project tasks: The project can be broken down into the following high level tasks:
Scripting and cleaning: Scripts will need to be written responsible for reading the CSV files in which the research data is currently saved in, processing that data and storing it into a database.
Full stack application: A front-end interface that will allow the user to search, filter and view the findings. A backend that can perform fetch operations from the database, dynamically create a dataframe on the underlying data, perform statistical methods on the dataframe and return the response to the client.
